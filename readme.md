## Install Git

### Check Git Version

Before you start using Git, ensure that itâ€™s installed on your system:

```bash
git --version
```

## SetUp Git(One-time Setup):
Git requires you to set up your user identity for tracking purposes.

## Git Configuration:
```bash
git config --global user.name "username"
git config --global user.email "email"
```
## check configuration :
Check your Git configuration details:
```bash
git config --global --list
```
## Create local Repository:

To create a new Git repository locally, navigate to your project folder and run:

```bash
git init
```
## Add File to the Repository:

To start tracking a specific file:

```bash
git add filename
```
-- To add all the files:

```bash
git add .
```
## Check status of the files:

View the status of files in the repository (whether they are staged, unstaged, or untracked):

```bash
git status
```
## Commit changes:

Once files are staged, commit them to the repository with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "message to be commited"
```
# Create the remote repository Through the terminal:

Using GitHub CLI, log in and create a new repository:


```bash
gh auth login
gh create repo repositry-name --public
gh create repo repository-name --private
```

## Link your local repo to the remote repository:

Once the remote repository is created, link it to your local repository:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```
## Push local files to the remote repository:

To upload your changes from the local repository to GitHub, push to the desired branch:

```bash
git push origin branch-name
```
## Rename the branch name:
```bash
git branch -M master main
```
-- change the branch from master to main.


## Push files with only one time branch mentioning
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
## Take changes from the remote repository to the local :

To sync your local repository with the remote one:

```bash
git pull origin branch-name
```
## Check the commit changes history:
```bash
git log
```
# Branches:

## Create branch:

Branching allows you to create new features or fix bugs without affecting the main branch:

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```
## Switches between branches:

To switch back to another branch:

```bash
git checkout branch-name
```
## Merge 2 Branches:

To merge changes from one branch into the current branch:

```bash
git merge branch-name
```
This will merge the branch you mention to your current branch.

## Delete Branch:

After merging, if you no longer need the branch, you can delete it:

```bash
git branch -d branch-name
```
## Undo Changes:
-- To unchange the files:
```bash
git reset file-name
```
## Undo all changes(not commited yet):
```bash
git checkout --filename
```
## Adding .gitignore file

-- gitignore file not push unneccessary files to your remote repo.
for example:
```bash
.env
node_module/`
```
# Push to remote repo (first time ever):
 
 If this is your first push to a new repository, you may need to set the upstream branch:
 
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin main
```
# Forking and Contributing to Other Repositories
To contribute to other repositories:

- Fork the repository on GitHub.
- Clone your fork locally.
- Make your changes and commit.
- Push your changes to your forked repository.
- Create a Pull Request to the original repository.
